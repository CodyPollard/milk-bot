Custom Discord Bot

# Information needed if you run your own version of this bot #
Create the file "quotes.txt" in the /misc folder. Before deploying your bot you also need to make changes 
to the !templink, !info, and !ra command. 
!templink - Replace the hardcoded discord invite link with your own.
!info - Replace your github link if you create your own branch.
!ra - Either create the role 'Bot Tester' or rename the role for whichever role you would like to grant users.
